# BlueBox
Completed over August 2020
Released on 15th September 2020

## Explanation
This is a rather simple CTF developed as part of an online learning course.
I did not make this alone, but as part of a group; we all agreed that we could upload the work to our personal GitHub pages if we wanted.
By my admission, this is not the most creative or *intuitive* CTF; but it does demonstrate basic concepts such as SQL injection, steganography and privilege escalation.

## Download
BlueBox is 1.5GB; this is too large to store on GitHub.
You can download BlueBox [here](https://mega.nz/file/4SQyBYaY#nbUqfP6lFYcjnfn6qveB_x3aCTADNS7uDRQu-iVnN9w), from MEGA.

## Tips and Hints
- Each flag is a hint for the next flag.
- Consider starting with an *nmap* scan.
- **Flag 1** - If only you could inject some SQL...
- **Flag 2** - Look at the URL; could you change the file name?
- **Flag 3** - How might you connect to the machine? Do you have any clues for the username and password? Perhaps a list of words?
- **Flag 4** - The Sonic Screwdriver has a sticky bit...
- **Flag 5** - At the root of all this, a Dalek is waiting - he's hiding something though...
